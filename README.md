# Dentist Backend Application

This is an university project - my master thesis in Computer Science and Engineering.

It's a REST service oriented backend application for a dentist system, which is platform independant.

Technologies used: Java 8, Docker container, Maven as a build tool, MySQL as database, Swagger UI as a REST API documentation.

The following features are implemented:

- Patient tooth health status.
- History of the previous patient manipulations.
- Delete and update of the patient data.
- Information record what's done on the patient as manipulation, price, activies description.
- Patient diagnose(s), which is selected from list of services.
- An option for additional description of the diagnose(s).
- List with health insurance prices and without healthy insurance prices.
